# Third-party notices

SPLICR Studio packages include separate `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe` command-line programs so
local audio and video processing works without a separate installation. FFmpeg is a third-party
project and is not owned by SPLICR Studio. FFmpeg builds may be distributed under the GNU Lesser
General Public License (LGPL) or GNU General Public License (GPL), depending on their configured
features.

The adjacent `BUILD_INFO.txt` records the version, configuration, and license banner reported by
the exact executables bundled in this package. FFmpeg licensing information and source releases are
available from:

- https://ffmpeg.org/legal.html
- https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

The release publisher must review the recorded configuration and provide all notices, license text,
and corresponding source or source offer required by that particular build before distributing the
package publicly.

The `0.1.0-dev.5` Windows acceptance candidate uses the checksum-pinned BtbN
`ffmpeg-n9.0.2-3-ga5923073bf-win64-lgpl-shared-9.0.zip` asset. Its recorded configuration enables
shared libraries and OpenH264 while disabling libx264, libx265, and other GPL-only codecs used by
the earlier internal candidate. The package preserves FFmpeg's `LICENSE.txt`, a `SOURCE_INFO.txt`
record containing the exact download URL and SHA-256, and the generated `BUILD_INFO.txt`. A public
publisher must still provide the exact corresponding source and complete the distribution review;
this notice does not itself make a legal determination.

## OpenH264

The bundled FFmpeg build exposes the OpenH264 encoder. The pinned OpenH264 source revision is
`8b2d28faade10d74d99ac80e199aef664c9c5a3b`.

OpenH264 source license SHA-256: dd5c1c9668512530fa5a96e4c29ac4033d70a7eeb0eed7a42fddb6dd794ebdbb

This source license notice does not determine codec patent rights. In particular, SPLICR does not
claim that Cisco's separate patent terms for Cisco-distributed OpenH264 binaries apply to the
third-party BtbN build; that release review remains open.

## libogg

The bundled FFmpeg dependency graph includes libogg at pinned source revision
`06a5e0262cdc28aa4ae6797627a783b5010440f0`.

libogg source license SHA-256: d2ab5758336489da61c12cc5bb757da5339c4ae9001f9bb0562b4370249af814
